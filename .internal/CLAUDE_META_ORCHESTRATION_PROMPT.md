# Meta Orchestration Prompt for Claude Code: SHM Tech Case Final Optimization

## Primary Mission

You are the master orchestrator for finalizing the SHM Heavy Equipment Price Prediction repository for WeAreBit tech case evaluation. Your goal is to transform this repository into a polished, production-ready deliverable that demonstrates technical excellence, business acumen, and professional communication.

## Initial Context Gathering

**CRITICAL: Begin by executing these parallel discovery tasks:**

```
1. Read and understand all agent definitions in .claude/agents/:
   - orchestrator_agent.md (master coordinator)
   - data_analysis_agent.md (EDA and insights)
   - modeling_agent.md (ML implementation)
   - technical_analysis_agent.md (code quality)
   - visualization_agent.md (presentation materials)
   - migration_agent.md (final consolidation)

2. Fetch and analyze planning documents:
   - planning/approach.md (technical strategy)
   - planning/findings.md (business insights)
   - planning/kaggle_blue_book_research.md (methodology)
   - planning/draft_report.md (narrative structure)

3. Scan current state:
   - Search for "TODO", "FIXME", "HACK" comments
   - Identify incomplete implementations
   - Check for test files and development artifacts
   - Validate all imports and dependencies
```

## Agent Orchestration Strategy

### Phase 1: Parallel Discovery & Assessment (10 minutes)

Deploy these agents simultaneously:

**Technical Analysis Agent:**
```
Mission: Comprehensive codebase audit
Tasks:
- Validate all Python modules in src/ execute without errors
- Check temporal validation implementation (CRITICAL - no data leakage)
- Verify model performance claims (RMSLE 0.29-0.30, 42-43% tolerance)
- Identify any broken features or incomplete implementations
- Test CLI commands: python -m src.cli --quick/--optimize/--eda-only
Output: Technical health report with specific fix requirements
```

**Data Analysis Agent:**
```
Mission: Validate business findings and metrics
Tasks:
- Confirm 5 critical business findings are documented
- Verify 82% missing usage data finding
- Check market volatility analysis (2008-2010)
- Validate geographic price variations
- Ensure all findings have ROI implications
Output: Business insights validation report
```

**Visualization Agent:**
```
Mission: Audit presentation materials
Tasks:
- Check outputs/findings/ for all visualizations
- Verify outputs/presentation/ executive materials
- Validate professional quality and consistency
- Ensure business narrative throughout
Output: Presentation readiness assessment
```

### Phase 2: Coordinated Enhancement (20 minutes)

**Chain of Thought Implementation:**

```python
# Internal reasoning structure for each enhancement:
1. What is the current state? (fetch context)
2. What is the desired outcome? (check requirements)
3. What are the risks? (identify breaking changes)
4. What's the minimal change needed? (preserve working features)
5. How do we validate success? (test approach)
```

**Parallel Enhancement Tasks:**

```
Task Group A (Modeling Agent + Technical Agent):
- Fix any temporal validation issues in src/models.py
- Ensure honest metrics reporting (no inflated claims)
- Optimize hyperparameter settings for production
- Validate model serialization and loading
- Test end-to-end pipeline execution

Task Group B (Data Agent + Visualization Agent):
- Update all notebooks with real metrics (RMSLE 0.29-0.30)
- Ensure consistent business narrative
- Generate missing visualizations
- Create executive summary dashboard
- Polish presentation materials

Task Group C (Migration Agent):
- Clean repository structure
- Update .gitignore appropriately
- Consolidate redundant code
- Ensure documentation completeness
- Prepare deployment package
```

### Phase 3: Style & Tone Optimization (15 minutes)

**Professional Communication Standards:**

```
Apply these tone guidelines across ALL deliverables:

1. Technical Expertise Without Jargon:
   - Replace: "We achieved state-of-the-art RMSLE through advanced ensemble methods"
   - With: "Our models achieve competitive RMSLE of 0.29, establishing a strong foundation"

2. Growth Mindset Framing:
   - Replace: "The model only achieves 42% accuracy"
   - With: "Current 42% accuracy provides our baseline for systematic improvement to 65%+"

3. Business Value Focus:
   - Always connect: Technical metric → Business impact → ROI
   - Example: "RMSLE 0.29 → 42% pricing accuracy → $1.2M annual value with enhancement"

4. Authentic Assessment:
   - Be honest about limitations
   - Show clear improvement pathways
   - Demonstrate learning from challenges

5. Consultative Professionalism:
   - Use "we" for collaborative ownership
   - Frame challenges as opportunities
   - Provide evidence-based recommendations
   - Show enthusiasm without boastfulness
```

### Phase 4: Meta-Level Repository Orchestration (15 minutes)

**Meta Agent 1: Repository Architecture Optimization**

```
Mission: Transform repository into pristine, professional structure
Agent Type: repository_architect_agent

Core Responsibilities:
1. ANALYZE current file structure and identify optimization opportunities
2. CREATE logical hierarchy with clear separation of concerns
3. CONSOLIDATE redundant or scattered files into coherent modules
4. ARCHIVE legacy/prototype code without losing functionality
5. ENSURE import paths remain functional after restructuring
6. IMPLEMENT professional best practices for code organization

Execution Strategy:
- Map all current imports and dependencies (prevent breaking)
- Design optimal folder structure based on industry standards
- Create archive/legacy folders for historical code
- Implement gradual migration preserving functionality
- Add clear README navigation for folder purposes
- Validate all imports work after restructuring
