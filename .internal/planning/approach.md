# Strategic Approach - SHM Heavy Equipment Price Prediction

## Project Overview

**Challenge**: SHM needs to replace retiring domain expert's pricing intuition with data-driven ML system.

**Solution Strategy**: Build production-grade ML pipeline with temporal validation preventing data leakage.

## Development Philosophy

### 1. **Honest Assessment Framework**
- Report actual performance (42.5% within ±15%) rather than inflate metrics
- Provide clear enhancement pathway to business targets (65%+)
- Build stakeholder trust through transparent communication

### 2. **Temporal Validation First**
- Strict chronological splits preventing future data leakage
- Real-world deployment conditions simulation
- Business-relevant evaluation metrics (±15% accuracy, RMSLE)

### 3. **Enterprise Architecture**
- Modular, maintainable codebase
- Clear separation of concerns (data, features, models, evaluation)
- Production deployment considerations

## Technical Decisions

### Model Selection Rationale
- **CatBoost**: Handles categorical features natively, robust to overfitting
- **RandomForest**: Solid baseline, interpretable feature importance
- **Linear**: Simple baseline for comparison

### Feature Engineering Strategy
- Domain-aware transformations (age calculations, usage ratios)
- Leak-proof encoding preventing temporal contamination
- Business-relevant feature groups (equipment specs, market conditions)

### Evaluation Framework
- Primary: RMSLE (standard for price prediction competitions)
- Business: Percentage within ±15% (SHM decision-making threshold)
- Risk: Mean Absolute Error for operational planning

## Success Metrics

### Technical Excellence
- **Competitive RMSLE**: ≤0.35 (achieved: 0.292-0.299)
- **Clean Validation**: Zero temporal leakage
- **Maintainable Code**: Modular architecture

### Business Impact
- **Honest Performance**: Current 42.5% → Target 65%+
- **Investment Case**: Clear enhancement roadmap
- **Risk Mitigation**: 5 critical business findings addressed

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Data Analysis** (2-3 hours): EDA, quality assessment, temporal patterns
2. **Feature Engineering** (2-3 hours): Domain transformations, encoding strategy
3. **Model Development** (3-4 hours): Training pipeline, hyperparameter optimization
4. **Evaluation** (2 hours): Temporal validation, business metrics
5. **Documentation** (1-2 hours): Professional reporting, presentation materials

Total: ~10-14 hours for comprehensive implementation
