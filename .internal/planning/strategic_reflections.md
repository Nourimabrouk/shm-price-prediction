# Strategic Reflections - WeAreBit Assessment Journey

## Development Iterations

### Phase 1: Foundation Building
- **Challenge**: Understanding domain and data characteristics
- **Approach**: Comprehensive EDA with business context focus
- **Key Insight**: Temporal structure critical - sale date patterns show clear leakage risks

### Phase 2: Feature Engineering
- **Challenge**: Extract business-relevant signals without data leakage
- **Approach**: Domain-aware transformations (age calculations, usage patterns)
- **Key Decision**: Strict temporal discipline - no future information in features

### Phase 3: Model Development
- **Challenge**: Balance performance with interpretability
- **Approach**: Multiple algorithms with consistent evaluation framework
- **Key Insight**: CatBoost handles categorical features elegantly, RandomForest provides interpretability

### Phase 4: Business Translation
- **Challenge**: Convert technical metrics to business impact
- **Approach**: Focus on Â±15% accuracy (realistic business threshold)
- **Key Strategy**: Honest assessment builds credibility vs. inflated promises
