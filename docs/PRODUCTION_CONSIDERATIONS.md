### **API Design Considerations**
```python
# Production API endpoints
/api/v1/predict/single          # Individual equipment valuation
/api/v1/predict/batch           # Bulk prediction processing
/api/v1/health                  # System health monitoring
/api/v1/metrics                 # Model performance metrics
/api/v1/retrain                 # Triggered model retraining
```

### **Alert Thresholds**
```yaml
alerts:
  prediction_accuracy:
    warning: "RMSLE > 0.35"
    critical: "RMSLE > 0.50"
  
  response_time:
    warning: "latency > 500ms"
    critical: "latency > 1000ms"
  
  error_rate:
    warning: "errors > 2%"
    critical: "errors > 5%"
```
