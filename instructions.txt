# SHM Heavy Equipment Price Prediction - Tech Case

## Business Context
**Company**: SHM (secondhand machinery dealer)
**Problem**: Replace retiring expert's pricing knowledge with ML prediction
**Dataset**: Historical auction data with equipment features and prices
**Timeline**: 4-hour assessment (2-3h analysis, 1-2h modeling, 1h reporting)

## Assignment Requirements

### Core Tasks
1. **Dataset Analysis**: Identify 5 key findings that warrant special attention
2. **Feature Analysis**: Analyze features and target variable
3. **Preprocessing Strategy**: Define data preparation steps
4. **Model Selection**: Choose and justify model approach
5. **Evaluation Framework**: Define evaluation methodology
6. **Time Allocation**: Provide realistic time estimates

### Deliverables
- **Code**: Python notebook with complete analysis
- **Report**: Structured approach documentation
- **Business Focus**: Explain why approach suits this use case

## AI Agent Best Practices for This Case

### Meta-Optimal Agent Strategy

#### 1. Data Analysis Agent
- **Focus**: Comprehensive EDA identifying business-critical insights
- **Key Tasks**: Missing data analysis, temporal patterns, price distributions
- **Success Metric**: Clear identification of 5 standout findings
- **Time Budget**: 2 hours maximum

#### 2. Modeling Agent
- **Focus**: Robust model selection with business justification
- **Key Models**: Baseline (Random Forest) + Advanced (CatBoost)
- **Success Metric**: Achieve >80% accuracy within 15% price tolerance
- **Time Budget**: 1-1.5 hours maximum

#### 3. Migration Agent
- **Focus**: Transform prototype to professional deliverable
- **Key Tasks**: Clean code structure, comprehensive notebook, documentation
- **Success Metric**: Production-ready repository with single main notebook
- **Time Budget**: Continuous integration throughout process

### Advanced Prompting Strategies

#### Context Priming
```
You are a senior ML engineer at Bit consulting for SHM. The client needs 
a data-driven pricing system to replace their retiring expert. Focus on 
business value and practical implementation over academic perfection.
```

#### Constraint Awareness
- **Time Constraint**: 4-hour assessment, not 3-week project
- **Business Constraint**: Must be interpretable and trustworthy
- **Data Constraint**: 412K records, high cardinality categoricals
- **Technical Constraint**: Handle 82% missing usage data

#### Success Criteria
- Demonstrate ML competency appropriate for consulting role
- Show business acumen with practical recommendations
- Deliver professional presentation ready for client review
- Balance technical depth with time constraints

### Agent Coordination Protocol

#### Sequential Execution
1. **Data Agent** → Comprehensive EDA and finding identification
2. **Modeling Agent** → Model development and evaluation
3. **Migration Agent** → Professional packaging and presentation

#### Quality Gates
- Each agent validates previous work before proceeding
- Business value maintained throughout pipeline
- Time budget monitored and adjusted dynamically
- Professional presentation standards enforced
