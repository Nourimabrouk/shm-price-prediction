   "source": "# SHM Heavy Equipment Price Prediction - Initial Analysis Prototype\n\n**WeAreBit Technical Assessment | ML Engineering Team**\n\n---\n\n## Executive Overview\n\nThis notebook documents the initial exploration and prototyping approach for SHM's heavy equipment price prediction challenge. As their longtime pricing expert approaches retirement, SHM needs a systematic, data-driven approach to replace institutional pricing knowledge.\n\n**Business Context**: SHM deals in secondhand heavy machinery where pricing decisions currently rely on expert intuition. The challenge is to develop a machine learning system that can predict sale prices with sufficient accuracy to maintain competitive advantage.\n\n**Technical Approach**: This analysis is structured to first understand the data landscape, identify key business constraints, and prototype model approaches before developing the production pipeline.\n\n---"
