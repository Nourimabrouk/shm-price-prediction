# SHM Heavy Equipment Price Prediction - Executive Summary

## Project Overview
WeAreBit Tech Case Assessment - Machine Learning Solution for Heavy Equipment Valuation

## Key Findings

### 1. Critical Missing Usage Data (82%)
**Finding:** 82% of records lack machine hours data, severely impacting depreciation modeling capabilities.

**Business Impact:** High - Usage is critical for equipment valuation

**Recommendation:** Develop proxy measures for equipment condition/usage

### 2. High-Cardinality Model Complexity (5 features)
**Finding:** 5 categorical features have >100 unique values, requiring specialized handling.

**Business Impact:** Medium - Affects model training and inference speed

**Recommendation:** Use target encoding or embedding approaches

### 3. Market Volatility Period Detected (2008-2010)
**Finding:** Significant price volatility during financial crisis period affects model stability.

**Business Impact:** High - Time-aware validation critical for model reliability

**Recommendation:** Use chronological validation splits, consider regime-specific models

### 4. Data Preprocessing Requirements
**Finding:** Dataset requires comprehensive preprocessing for ML modeling.

**Business Impact:** Medium - Affects model development timeline

**Recommendation:** Develop robust preprocessing pipeline

### 5. Geographic Price Variations
**Finding:** Significant regional pricing differences (80% variance between states).

**Business Impact:** High - Affects regional pricing strategies and market positioning

**Recommendation:** Implement location-aware pricing models for regional optimization
