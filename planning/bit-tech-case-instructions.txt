tech-case instructions
SHM is a company that buys and sells secondhand machinery.
Currently, the sales price of a machine is determined by an
expert that has worked at the company for a long time, and
therefore has a 'feeling' for the worth of a machine.
However, the expert is retiring and thus SHM is looking for an
alternative way to determine the sales price. Luckily, they have
a lot of historical data about the properties of the machines
and their pricing.
Since they have heard that machine learning is the next big
thing, they turn to Bit with the assignment to setup a possible
approach if and how the price could be predicted.

Assignment You will be provided with the historical dataset. We ask
you to perform the following tasks.
Analyse the dataset and the features. Report a maximum of 5 things that
stand out and warrant special attention.
Your report should contain the following:
O Analysis of the features and target
Your steps on how you would preprocess the dataset
이 Your model(s) choice and explanation for this decision
Ο Your steps on how you would evaluate the model(s)
이 The (rough) time allocation for each components of the approach
We expect you to deliver:
이 Code to run the analysis. Can be an export of a notebook.
Report with your approach as explained in the above bullet points.
