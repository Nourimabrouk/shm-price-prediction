Team Discussion & Follow-Up Prompts
Based on this initial implementation, here are five strategic follow-up prompts that different team members at WeAreBit might raise:
1. Business Strategist Perspective
"How can we incorporate external market indicators to make the model more responsive to economic cycles? Construction equipment demand correlates strongly with infrastructure spending and commodity prices. Should we integrate construction indices, steel prices, or regional GDP growth to improve our 6-month price forecasts? This could differentiate SHM's pricing from competitors who only use historical data."
2. ML Engineer / Technical Deep-Dive
"The model shows 12% MAPE, but I'm concerned about performance on rare, high-value equipment (>$1M). Should we implement a hierarchical model structure where expensive equipment gets specialized treatment? Also, can we add uncertainty quantification using conformal prediction or Bayesian approaches to give sales teams confidence intervals for negotiation ranges?"
3. Product Manager / UX Focus
"How do we package this for the sales team who've relied on gut feeling for decades? We need an explainability layer - perhaps SHAP values visualized as 'price drivers' showing why each quote differs from baseline. Should we build a What-If simulator where salespeople can adjust parameters (usage hours, location) to see price impacts in real-time?"
4. Data Engineering / Production Readiness
"What's our strategy for model drift monitoring and automated retraining? Equipment markets can shift rapidly (COVID showed us that). Should we implement A/B testing infrastructure with automatic rollback if performance degrades? Also, how do we handle new equipment models that weren't in training data - do we need a similarity-based fallback mechanism?"
5. Innovation Lead / Future Vision
"This solves today's pricing problem, but what about tomorrow? Can we extend this to predict optimal selling timing - when will this equipment reach peak resale value? Or integrate computer vision to assess equipment condition from photos? There's also potential for a marketplace recommendation engine: 'Customers who bought this excavator also needed...' What's the roadmap for turning this into a comprehensive equipment intelligence platform?"

EDA & Audit
“Run a fast EDA on C:\Users\Nouri\Documents\GitHub\bit-tech-case\Bit_SHM_data.csv: parse dates; compute age_years, hours_per_year; report missingness, top categorical cardinalities, and give 5 standout issues with counts and examples (esp. Auctioneer ID=1000, Year Made<1930, duplicated columns). Use temporal histograms of sales.”

Baselines
“Fit a semi‑log OLS (hedonic) baseline on a temporal split (≤2009 train, 2010 val, 2011 test). Report RMSLE/MAE/MAPE and coefficients for age/hours/product_group/top states.”

CatBoost primary
“Train CatBoost on log1p(price) with categorical columns auto‑detected; early stopping on 2010; evaluate on 2011. Show top features and per‑feature SHAP bars or importances.”

Uncertainty
“Wrap the best model with MAPIE to produce 80% and 95% prediction intervals; show calibration coverage on 2011 and 5 example explanations for sales reps.”

Ablations
“Run a quick ablation: global model vs per‑ProductGroup models; report delta in RMSLE and any stability changes.”
