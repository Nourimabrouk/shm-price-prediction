def get_catboost_smart_defaults(n_samples: int, n_features: int, n_categoricals: int) -> dict:
    # Automatically scale parameters based on SHM data characteristics
    if n_samples > 300000:        # SHM has 412K+ records
        iterations = 1000
    if n_categoricals > 1000:     # SHM has 5K+ equipment models
        depth = 8                 # Deeper trees for high-cardinality categoricals
    learning_rate = 0.05 if n_samples > 200000 else 0.08  # Size-adaptive learning
```

**Three-Stage Time-Bounded Optimization**:
- **Stage 1**: Smart defaults (immediate) - eliminates parameter guesswork
- **Stage 2**: Coarse grid search (15 min) - high-impact parameter exploration
- **Stage 3**: Fine-tuning (remaining time) - precision optimization around best parameters

def parse_feet_inches(self, x) -> float:
    """Convert "11' 6\"" → 138.0 inches with robust regex parsing."""
    m = re.match(r"^\s*(\d+)\s*'\s*(\d+)?\s*\"?\s*$", s)
    if m:
        feet = float(m.group(1))
        inches = float(m.group(2) or 0.0)
        return feet * 12.0 + inches
```

**Business-Aware Missing Value Detection**:
```python
# Recognizes that zero machine hours are likely data entry errors
if 'machinehours_currentmeter' in df.columns:
    df.loc[df['machinehours_currentmeter'].fillna(0) == 0, 'machinehours_currentmeter'] = np.nan
```

**Production-Ready Fallback Path System**: Handles various deployment environments with automatic path resolution.

- **Innovation**: Parameters automatically adjust based on dataset characteristics (n_samples, n_features, n_categoricals)
- **Learning**: Heavy equipment data requires deeper trees (depth=8) for high-cardinality categoricals vs. standard recommendation (depth=6)
- **Business Value**: Eliminates manual hyperparameter tuning expertise requirement

#### 2. **Time-Bounded Optimization with Graceful Degradation**
```python
# Stage 3: Fine tuning (remaining time)
remaining_time = time_budget_minutes - (time.time() - start_time) / 60
if remaining_time > 5 and best_coarse_params is not None:
    # Proceed with fine-tuning
else:
    # Graceful fallback to coarse results
    final_params = {**base_params, **best_coarse_params}
```
- **Learning**: Production systems require time guarantees; optimization must never exceed business constraints
- **Innovation**: Three-tier fallback system ensures deployment success even with partial optimization

#### 3. **Domain-Aware Data Quality Intelligence**
- **Innovation**: Automatic detection that zero machine hours indicate missing data, not actual usage
- **Learning**: Heavy equipment domain knowledge embedded in preprocessing logic
- **Business Impact**: Prevents model training on corrupted signals

#### 4. **Market Volatility-Aware Validation Strategy**

2. **Missing Data Strategy**: Zero machine hours are data quality issues, not actual usage patterns - requires domain-specific handling

3. **Temporal Validation Necessity**: Financial crisis periods (2008-2010) create distinct market regimes requiring chronological validation splits

4. **High-Cardinality Management**: 5,000+ equipment models require native categorical handling rather than encoding strategies

5. **Production Deployment Reality**: Time-bounded optimization with graceful degradation more valuable than theoretical optimal parameters

### Advanced Mathematical Insights

#### Equipment Depreciation Modeling Without Usage Data
- **Challenge**: 82% missing machine hours eliminates primary depreciation signal
- **Solution**: Age-based proxy combined with market timing features
- **Innovation**: `hours_per_year = machine_hours / age.clip(lower=0.5)` creates usage intensity when both available

    """Time-aware split with audit trail to prevent temporal data leakage."""
    # Stable temporal sorting (mergesort maintains order for equal dates)
    order = df[date_col].argsort(kind="mergesort")
    
    # Audit trail for temporal split integrity
    print(f"🕒 [TEMPORAL AUDIT] Split integrity: {'✅ VALID' if end_train <= start_val else '❌ DATA LEAKAGE DETECTED'}")
```

**Business Impact**: **CRITICAL** - Prevents future information leakage in financial time series data, ensuring realistic model performance estimates for equipment valuation decisions.
